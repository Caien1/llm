Once upon a time in a small village, there lived a farmer and his family.
They worked hard every day, planting seeds and harvesting crops.
The sun rose early and set late, giving them enough time to finish their chores.
Children played in the fields, chasing butterflies and laughing with joy.
In the evenings, the family gathered around a fire to share stories.
Sometimes, they spoke of animals they had seen, or travelers who passed through.
One day, a stranger arrived in the village with news from the distant mountains.
He told tales of great rivers, ancient trees, and skies filled with stars.
The villagers listened closely, wondering if they would ever see such places.
Even the old dog, usually asleep, seemed to perk up and listen.
The next morning, the stranger was gone, but his stories remained in their hearts
